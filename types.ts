/*
we're using Socket.IO in a Next.js API Route (probably under /pages/api/socket.ts or similar), and you're trying to extend the default NextApiResponse type so that it includes the Socket.IO server instance.

âœ… Breakdown of NextApiResponseServerIo:

export type NextApiResponseServerIo = NextApiResponse & {
  socket: Socket & {
    server: NetServer & {
      io: ServerIOServer;
    };
  };
};
This creates a custom type for your res object (response) in an API route that lets TypeScript know you're attaching Socket.IO to the HTTP server.
